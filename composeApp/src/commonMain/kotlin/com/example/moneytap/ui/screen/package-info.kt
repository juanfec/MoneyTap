/**
 * Screen Composables
 *
 * This package contains full-screen composable functions.
 *
 * Guidelines:
 * - Name screens as nouns ending with "Screen" (e.g., HomeScreen, ProfileScreen)
 * - Use state hoisting: screens receive state and callbacks as parameters
 * - Collect ViewModel state with collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
 * - Keep screens focused on layout composition, not business logic
